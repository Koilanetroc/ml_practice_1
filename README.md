# Description
It's a small example of linear regression with multiple variables written on python using pandas and numpy. There are two versions here:

- ```one_varibale.py```
Linear regression with only one varibale(just warm-up). It uses training_data1.txt, where placed 97 lines of training data.
- ```multiple_varibales.py```
Linear regression with multiple variables(algorithm can work with any number of variables) and mean normalization. It uses training_data2.txt where placed 47 examples of calculations of the house prices. First variable is size of the house, the second is a number of rooms. Last one is a price of the house. Because of different varibales ranges we use mean normalization.

#### Both algorithms use gradient descent for learning

# How to run?
It's quite easy:   
```python one_variable.py```   
```python multiple_varibales.py```
